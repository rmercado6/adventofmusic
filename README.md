üåê [adventofmusic.rmercado.dev](adventofmusic.rmercado.dev)

Welcome to **Advent of Music** ‚Äî a musical composition challenge designed to inspire creativity, improve your
compositional skills, and bring joy to the holiday season! Inspired by the popular *Advent of Code*, Advent of Music
presents a unique set of daily challenges during the Advent period (December 1st to 24th), each focusing on different
aspects of music composition.

Every day, you'll be given a new challenge to help you grow as a composer. These challenges range from writing simple
melodies and themes to orchestrating more complex pieces, providing a fun and educational way to build your skills day
by day.

Whether you're a seasoned composer or a beginner looking to improve your musical abilities, Advent of Music is the
perfect opportunity to explore new techniques, experiment with ideas, and push your creative boundaries ‚Äî all while
celebrating the festive spirit of the season.

## How It Works

- **Duration**: The challenge runs from **December 1st to 24th**, with one new task released each day.
- **Challenges**: Each task varies in difficulty and scope. Some may focus on writing a short melody, others on
  arranging or orchestrating, and some may include more technical composition problems like counterpoint, harmony, or
  form.
- **Progress**: You can complete each task at your own pace, but try to keep up with the daily challenges to stay in the
  rhythm of the Advent season!
- **No Prior Experience Needed**: Whether you're writing for piano, orchestra, or just experimenting with digital
  sounds, all participants are welcome, and you can adapt each challenge to your preferred medium or skill level.

## Why Participate?

- **Skill Building**: Develop your composition skills by working on diverse musical challenges every day.
- **Creative Inspiration**: Stay motivated and inspired to write music consistently throughout the month.
- **Fun Community**: Join a global community of music lovers and composers as you share ideas, collaborate, and enjoy
  the challenge together.
- **Celebrate the Holidays**: Make your holiday season even more musical by immersing yourself in a month of creative
  composition.
